# Machine Learning with Tree-Based Models in Python

Tree-based models are a family of supervised learning algorithms that create models in the form of a tree structure. 
These models are powerful and versatile, excelling in both regression and classification tasks.\
This Repository consist of the Tree Based Model notes. I am also going to attach Data Camp Solutions to it as well.
I am trying to create a basic notes file you you that you can review or read before implimenting ant tree based model to help you get started my the modeling.

## 1. Introduction

Tree-based models mimic human decision-making by learning decision rules from data. These models can handle categorical and numerical data and are non-parametric, making them flexible for a wide range of datasets.

## 2. Types of Tree-Based Models

### Decision Trees
- Single tree structure.
- Greedy algorithm to split data at each node.

### Ensemble Models
#### Random Forests
- Combines multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting.
- Bagging technique for training.

#### Gradient Boosting Machines
- Sequentially builds trees to minimize loss.
- More prone to overfitting but highly accurate.

#### XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost
- Popular implementations of gradient boosting with optimizations for speed and performance.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Splitting Criteria
- **Classification**: Gini Impurity, Entropy.
- **Regression**: Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### Overfitting and Pruning
- **Overfitting**: Trees growing too deep, capturing noise.
- **Pruning**: Reducing tree depth for simplicity.

### Feature Importance
- Helps in understanding the contribution of each feature.

## 4. Implementation in Python

### Libraries
- `scikit-learn`: For Decision Trees and Random Forests.
- `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`: For advanced boosting methods.

### Example Code (Random Forest)
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train Random Forest
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
y_pred = rf.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

```
## 5. Model Training and Evaluation

### Key Metrics
- **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC.
- **Regression**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.

### Cross-Validation
- K-fold validation to assess model robustness.

## 6. Advanced Topics

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Techniques**:
  - Grid Search
  - Random Search
  - Bayesian Optimization
- **Parameters to Tune**:
  - Depth
  - Learning Rate
  - Number of Trees

### Handling Imbalanced Data
- **Techniques**:
  - Resampling (Over-sampling, Under-sampling)
  - Weighted Loss Functions

### Feature Engineering
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- Standardization for numerical features (if required).

### Model Interpretability
- Tools like SHAP and LIME for understanding model predictions.

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Use ensemble methods for better performance.
- Regularize models to avoid overfitting.
- Validate models thoroughly before deployment.
